//getComputerChoice

Understanding problem

function that represents the computer playing the game
computer has to randomly pick between 3 choices

The algorithm

- generate random number
- round number down to percentage by multiplying 100
- set intervals that will equal a choice 
i.e 0 - 33 rock, 34 - 67 scissors and 68 - 99 paper

The pseudocode

generate random number
multiply by 100 to turn to percentage
make switch statement (maybe if statement is more appropriate here)
case number is between 0 and 33, choice is rock
create cases for the rest
return choice

//getHumanChoice

Understanding problem

function that will solicit and return the user's choice
user will be promted by browser

The Algorithm

- prompt user for input
- store input in variable
- return that input to use later

The pseudocode

initialize choice variable with prompt
enter user choice as a string in choice (add validation to make sure its only rock, paper or scissors?)
validate input to a valid choice for the game
if input is either rock, paper or scissors, store
else, ask them to enter one of those
return user choice


//playRound

Understanding problem

function that will take human and computer choices and decide a winner
announce winner and increment round win to winning player

The Algorithm and Pseudocode

//research better way to run these conditionals

- init function with human and computer choice args
- if human choice is rock and comp choice is rock
	- print out tie
	- increment both comp and human scores by 1
- if human choice is rock and comp choice is scissors
	- print out human win
	- increment human score by 1
- if human choice is rock and comp choice is paper
	- print out comp win
	- increment comp score by 1

- if human choice is scissors and comp choice is rock
	- print out comp win
	- increment comp score by 1
- if human choice is scissors and comp choice is scissors
	- print out tie
	- increment human and comp scores by 1
- if human choice is scissors and comp choice is paper
	- print out human win
	- increment human score by 1

- if human choice is paper and comp choice is rock
	- print out human win
	- increment human score by 1
- if human choice is paper and comp choice is scissors
	- print out comp win
	- increment comp score by 1
- if human choice is paper and comp choice is paper
	- print out tie
	- increment comp and human score by 1
